create_SCDO_terms_for_review_file.py
  -  This code was originally written in 2017 to export term annotations from the SCDO so that they could be reviewed in Excel format by SCDO Workshop attendees.
  -  It uses html files generated by Protege and a few user input files, to generate a file with terms for review.
  -  Input required:
      # A file containing the list of terms to be reviewed (This can be done separately for each main class or all SCDO terms can be given.
       (An easy way to create the file is to copy the tree of terms from Protege and paste in txt file (can right click on "SCDO" term and select "Copy sub-hierarchy as tab-indented text"))
      # the location of the "index.html" file in the "classes" folder (created when running "Export OWLDoc" in Protege (in Tools menu)).
      # a list of properties, where the properties are the ones that you want to be displayed first and their order is the order they should be displayed in. 
      # the location of the "classes" folder (created when running "Export OWLDoc" in Protege (in Tools menu)).
      # the name of the outputfile to be createdThe output is a .txt file
