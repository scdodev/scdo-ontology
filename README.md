## Acknowledgements

The Sickle Cell Disease Ontology (SCDO) project was originally a collaboration between [H3ABioNet (Pan African Bioinformatics Network)](http://www.h3abionet.org/) and SPAN (Sickle Cell Disease Pan African Network), but has since become an undertaking of the [SickleInAfrica Consortium](https://sickleinafrica.org/), through the work of dedicated SADaCC (Sickle Africa Data Coordinating Centre) curators and developers.
